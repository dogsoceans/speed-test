#   speed-test:  A schematic agent to brighten your day

Use speed-test to start a new “empty” Urbit app project.  Import the repo, then simply rename all text and files from `speed-test` to whatever your new agent's name will be.  Run `./rename.sh new-name` to replace all instances of `speed-test` with `new-name` throughout.

speed-test is modestly opinionated but generally straightforward.  If you are interested in having the `++abet` nested-core pattern in your agent, see [Moonrise](https://github.com/sigilante/moonrise).
